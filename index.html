<p>A fun fact about me is my interest in cars that my brother has definetly instilled in me. My dream car would definetly be a Tesla Model S, and the one car I would not purchase under any circumstance is a Mustang.</p>
<br>
<p>I really enjoy going shopping, and some of my favorite shops include <a href="https://www.sephora.com">Sephora</a>, <a href="https://www.vestique.com">Vestique</a>, and <a href="http://www.francescas.com">Francescas<a/>.
